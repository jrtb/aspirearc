&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
It was cold and an icy wind that blewalong Broadway and up through the narrowside street where Danny lived, a fierce windthat came off the river, which I could not see
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; for the darkness. The house was small, threestories, red brick, and old, very old. Fiveworn, stone stairs, a badly fitting woodendoor, a tiny overheated foyer withmailboxes, buttons, and nameplates. I
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt; pressed the button over the name Saunders. There was a loud answering buzz. I pushed open the heavy inner door and started up the steep, carpeted, narrow staircase. The door closed with a loud click. It was a little
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;15&lt;/b&gt; before eight o&apos;clock. Someone inside the house was frying bacon. The staircase was poorly lighted; the carpet was worn. It was a long climb up to the third floor. Danny was waiting for me in his
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;20&lt;/b&gt; doorway. He had on a dark woolen sweater and dark trousers. There was a skullcap on his head. His face was pale and he blinked at me wearily from behind his black shell- rimmed glasses.
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;25&lt;/b&gt; &quot;How are you, Danny? How are you really?&quot; &quot;Tired.&quot; &quot;You&apos;re always tired. Whenever I see you you&apos;re tired.&quot;
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;30&lt;/b&gt; &quot;It&apos;s the occupational disease of graduate school.&quot; &quot;How is Rachel?&quot; &quot;Rachel is fine.&quot; He sat down on the chair in front of
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;35&lt;/b&gt; the desk and did not look at me. &quot;Tell me about Michael,&quot; I said. He picked up his coffee cup, sipped some coffee, and put it back down on the desk.
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;40&lt;/b&gt; &quot;Michael is very sick.&quot; &quot;Thanks. Now tell me something about Michael I don&apos;t already know.&quot; &quot;You&apos;re angry,&quot; he said. &quot;I can&apos;t talk to you when you&apos;re angry.&quot;
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;45&lt;/b&gt; &quot;Tell me about Michael,&quot; I said quietly. &quot;What does he do?&quot; &quot;He doesn&apos;t do anything. He comes into a therapy session and just sits there. Oon&apos;t cooperate at all.&quot; &quot;Are you taking over the therapy?&quot; &quot;Yes. They&apos;re willing to try almost anything now. It&apos;s very serious with Michael.&quot;
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;55&lt;/b&gt; I found I could not stop thinking about Michael. There was the lake again and Michael&apos;s thin body near the center board of the sailfish and the gusting winds and the clouds scudding smoothly across the
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;60&lt;/b&gt; sky. &quot;There have been fist fights. Between Michael and some of the other boys.&quot; &quot;Fist fights,&quot; I said. I could not
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;65&lt;/b&gt; imagine Michael in a fist fight. &quot;He kicked a boy in the groin. During a lunch hour. He pushed him out of the chair and kicked him&quot;. &quot;How much time do you have?&quot;
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;70&lt;/b&gt; &quot;A month. Two months. It depends on whether there&apos;s any kind of progress&quot;. &quot;What if there&apos;s no progress, Danny?&quot; He glanced down at his desk and
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;75&lt;/b&gt; said nothing. &quot;Will he have to be institutionalized?&quot; I said. He did not say anything. &quot;My God,&quot; I said. &quot;My God....All
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;80&lt;/b&gt; because of a stupid carnival.&quot; He looked at me. &quot;Michael was sick long before that carnival. Crooks at carnivals don&apos;t make people sick. You have to be sick already to be affected that way.
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;85&lt;/b&gt; &quot;We had a beautiful time on that lake. He liked to read clouds. Did I tell you about that? He reads clouds.&quot; &quot;You told me.&quot; I finished the coffee. &quot;The summer
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;90&lt;/b&gt; seems very far away.&quot; He was quiet. &quot;It is far away,&quot; I said. I put the empty coffee cup on the floor and leaned back against the wall and closed my eyes. I
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;95&lt;/b&gt; could not stop thinking about Michael....There was the cove and the smooth shallow water with the tall trees of the shoreline breaking the force of the wind and Michael lying on his back reading the
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;100&lt;/b&gt; clouds. There was the cove and the birds  high overhead and the clouds white against  the deep blue of the sky and the whisper of  the wind through the trees, a loud  whisper...and I saw Michael standing up in
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;105&lt;/b&gt; the roller coaster, his face to the wind...and  the sensation of dropping into the night.
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;50&lt;/b&gt; absolute lies. He won&apos;t cooperate at all.&quot; &quot;Are you taking over the therapy?&quot; &quot;Yes. They&apos;re willing to try almost anything now. It&apos;s very serious with Michael.&quot;
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;55&lt;/b&gt; I found I could not stop thinking about Michael. There was the lake again and Michael&apos;s thin body near the center board of the sailfish and the gusting winds and the clouds scudding smoothly across the
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;60&lt;/b&gt; sky. &quot;There have been fist fights. Between Michael and some of the other boys.&quot; &quot;Fist fights,&quot; I said. I could not
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;65&lt;/b&gt; imagine Michael in a fist fight. &quot;He kicked a boy in the groin. During a lunch hour. He pushed him out of the chair and kicked him&quot;. &quot;How much time do you have?&quot;
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;70&lt;/b&gt; &quot;A month. Two months. It depends on whether there&apos;s any kind of progress&quot;. &quot;What if there&apos;s no progress, Danny?&quot; He glanced down at his desk and
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;75&lt;/b&gt; said nothing. &quot;Will he have to be institutionalized?&quot; I said. He did not say anything. &quot;My God,&quot; I said. &quot;My God....All
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;80&lt;/b&gt; because of a stupid carnival.&quot; He looked at me. &quot;Michael was sick long before that carnival. Crooks at carnivals don&apos;t make people sick. You have to be sick already to be affected that way.
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;85&lt;/b&gt; &quot;We had a beautiful time on that lake. He liked to read clouds. Did I tell you about that? He reads clouds.&quot; &quot;You told me.&quot; I finished the coffee. &quot;The summer
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;90&lt;/b&gt; seems very far away.&quot; He was quiet. &quot;It is far away,&quot; I said. I put the empty coffee cup on the floor and leaned back against the wall and closed my eyes. I
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;95&lt;/b&gt; could not stop thinking about Michael....There was the cove and the smooth shallow water with the tall trees of the shoreline breaking the force of the wind and Michael lying on his back reading the
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;100&lt;/b&gt; clouds. There was the cove and the birds  high overhead and the clouds white against  the deep blue of the sky and the whisper of  the wind through the trees, a loud  whisper...and I saw Michael standing up in
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;105&lt;/b&gt; the roller coaster, his face to the wind...and  the sensation of dropping into the night.

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
It was cold and an icy wind that blewalong Broadway and up through the narrowside street where Danny lived, a fierce windthat came off the river, which I could not see
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; for the darkness. The house was small, threestories, red brick, and old, very old. Fiveworn, stone stairs, a badly fitting woodendoor, a tiny overheated foyer withmailboxes, buttons, and nameplates. I
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt; pressed the button over the name Saunders. There was a loud answering buzz. I pushed open the heavy inner door and started up the steep, carpeted, narrow staircase. The door closed with a loud click. It was a little
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;15&lt;/b&gt; before eight o&apos;clock. Someone inside the house was frying bacon. The staircase was poorly lighted; the carpet was worn. It was a long climb up to the third floor. Danny was waiting for me in his
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;20&lt;/b&gt; doorway. He had on a dark woolen sweater and dark trousers. There was a skullcap on his head. His face was pale and he blinked at me wearily from behind his black shell- rimmed glasses.
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;25&lt;/b&gt; &quot;How are you, Danny? How are you really?&quot; &quot;Tired.&quot; &quot;You&apos;re always tired. Whenever I see you you&apos;re tired.&quot;
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;30&lt;/b&gt; &quot;It&apos;s the occupational disease of graduate school.&quot; &quot;How is Rachel?&quot; &quot;Rachel is fine.&quot; He sat down on the chair in front of
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;35&lt;/b&gt; the desk and did not look at me. &quot;Tell me about Michael,&quot; I said. He picked up his coffee cup, sipped some coffee, and put it back down on the desk.

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
It was cold and an icy wind that blewalong Broadway and up through the narrowside street where Danny lived, a fierce windthat came off the river, which I could not see
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; for the darkness. The house was small, threestories, red brick, and old, very old. Fiveworn, stone stairs, a badly fitting woodendoor, a tiny overheated foyer withmailboxes, buttons, and nameplates. I
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt; pressed the button over the name Saunders. There was a loud answering buzz. I pushed open the heavy inner door and started up the steep, carpeted, narrow staircase. The door closed with a loud click. It was a little
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;15&lt;/b&gt; before eight o&apos;clock. Someone inside the house was frying bacon. The staircase was poorly lighted; the carpet was worn. It was a long climb up to the third floor. Danny was waiting for me in his
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;20&lt;/b&gt; doorway. He had on a dark woolen sweater and dark trousers. There was a skullcap on his head. His face was pale and he blinked at me wearily from behind his black shell- rimmed glasses.
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;25&lt;/b&gt; &quot;How are you, Danny? How are you really?&quot; &quot;Tired.&quot; &quot;You&apos;re always tired. Whenever I see you you&apos;re tired.&quot;
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;30&lt;/b&gt; &quot;It&apos;s the occupational disease of graduate school.&quot; &quot;How is Rachel?&quot; &quot;Rachel is fine.&quot; He sat down on the chair in front of
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;35&lt;/b&gt; the desk and did not look at me. &quot;Tell me about Michael,&quot; I said. He picked up his coffee cup, sipped some coffee, and put it back down on the desk.
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;40&lt;/b&gt; &quot;Michael is very sick.&quot; &quot;Thanks. Now tell me something about Michael I don&apos;t already know.&quot; &quot;You&apos;re angry,&quot; he said. &quot;I can&apos;t talk to you when you&apos;re angry.&quot;
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;45&lt;/b&gt; &quot;Tell me about Michael,&quot; I said quietly. &quot;What does he do?&quot; &quot;He doesn&apos;t do anything. He comes into a therapy session and just sits there. Or he spouts dreams and fantasies that are
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;50&lt;/b&gt; absolute lies. He won&apos;t cooperate at all.&quot; &quot;Are you taking over the therapy?&quot; &quot;Yes. They&apos;re willing to try almost anything now. It&apos;s very serious with Michael.&quot;
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;55&lt;/b&gt; I found I could not stop thinking about Michael. There was the lake again and Michael&apos;s thin body near the center board of the sailfish and the gusting winds and the clouds scudding smoothly across the
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;60&lt;/b&gt; sky. &quot;There have been fist fights. Between Michael and some of the other boys.&quot; &quot;Fist fights,&quot; I said. I could not
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;65&lt;/b&gt; imagine Michael in a fist fight. &quot;He kicked a boy in the groin. During a lunch hour. He pushed him out of the chair and kicked him&quot;. &quot;How much time do you have?&quot;
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;70&lt;/b&gt; &quot;A month. Two months. It depends on whether there&apos;s any kind of progress&quot;. &quot;What if there&apos;s no progress, Danny?&quot; He glanced down at his desk and
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;75&lt;/b&gt; said nothing. &quot;Will he have to be institutionalized?&quot; I said. He did not say anything. &quot;My God,&quot; I said. &quot;My God....All
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;80&lt;/b&gt; because of a stupid carnival.&quot; He looked at me. &quot;Michael was sick long before that carnival. Crooks at carnivals don&apos;t make people sick. You have to be sick already to be affected that way.
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;85&lt;/b&gt; &quot;We had a beautiful time on that lake. He liked to read clouds. Did I tell you about that? He reads clouds.&quot; &quot;You told me.&quot; I finished the coffee. &quot;The summer

		<string>The existence of life on other planets is one of the most compelling ideas in science. Mars, the nearest planet to Earth, has been the focus of much speculation in this regard, in fiction and folklore as well as in scientific circles. Two planetary scientists appraise the possibility of the existence of Martian life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Planetary Scientist 1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The existence of Martian life is quite probable. True, the visions of Martian civilizations entertained by early astronomers, who observed artificial canal systems on Mars, proved false; these &quot;canals&quot; were only illusions produced by flawed telescope lenses. Life, however, can take simpler forms than the humanoid creatures envisioned by early scientists. Although Mars could probably not support large fauna, organisms as complex as bacteria or even small insects are quite plausible. Many environmental factors favor the development of Martian life. Spectrographic analysis has shown the white polar caps of Mars to be large ice deposits, potentially supplying life-supporting water to regions near the Martian poles, as polar ice melts and re-freezes with changing temperatures. Although atmospheric oxygen is extremely thin on Mars, Martian organisms might have correspondingly slow metabolisms, or take advantage of the abundant oxygen trapped in the Martian surface in the form of mineral oxides. Finally, Mars occupies an orbital position similar to that of Earth, thereby benefiting from similar levels of the sunlight which is necessary to life. Water, oxygen, and sunlight are the principle requirements of life as we know it. It is to be expected therefore that life has developed on Mars as on Earth, if only in simpler forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Planetary Scientist 2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Those who hope someday to discover alien life on Mars are sadly misguided. To begin with, the red planet&apos;s atmosphere is too thin to suppoorb a large proportion of stellar radiation as Earth&apos;s atmosphere does, with the result that the daylight surface of Mars is constantly bombarded by deadly ultraviolet radiation from the sun and other cosmic sources. Temperature stabilization, another function of atmosphere, is lacking on Mars, so that the surface temperature varies within a range of 200 degrees Fahrenheit from day to night: a torturous environment for life.
Living organisms also require an environment rich in organic compounds. The ideal circumstances for the origination of life include a kind of organic soup in which simple compounds may combine to form proteins, which are the building blocks of life. These compounds should ideally be suspended in water, to permit them to circulate and combine more readily. The Martian surface is largely devoid of organic compounds, as well as the moisture which encourages microscopic life. Given its poverty of oxygen, its organically poor soil and its high levels of solar radiation, Mars is an unlikely home for life of any kind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Planetary Scientist 2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Those who hope someday to discover alien life on Mars are sadly misguided. To begin with, the red planet&apos;s atmosphere is too thin to support respiration. More importantly, the sparse Martian atmosphere fails to absorb a large proportion of stellar radiation as Earth&apos;s atmosphere does, with the result that the daylight surface of Mars is constantly bombarded by deadly ultraviolet radiation from the sun and other cosmic sources. Temperature stabilization, another function of atmosphere, is lacking on Mars, so that the surface temperature varies within a range of 200 degrees Fahrenheit from day to night: a torturous environment for life.
Living organisms also require an environment rich in organic compounds. The ideal circumstances for the origination of life include a kind of organic soup in which simple compounds may combine to form proteins, which are the building blocks of life. These compounds should ideally be suspended in water, to permit them to circulate and combine more readily. The Martian surface is largely devoid of organic compounds, as well as the moisture which encourages microscopic life. Given its poverty of oxygen, its organically poor soil and its high levels of solar radiation, Mars is an unlikely home for life of any kind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
If scientists were to adapt terrestrial bacteria to survive in a Martian environment, which of the following adaptations would be desirable?&lt;br/&gt;
I. An outer coating which blocks large amounts of solar radiation&lt;br/&gt;
II. An accelerated oxygen-based metabolism&lt;br/&gt;
III. The ability to survive consuming only simple proteins&lt;br/&gt;</string>

		<string>The existence of life on other planets is one of the most compelling ideas in science. Mars, the nearest planet to Earth, has been the focus of much speculation in this regard, in fiction and folklore as well as in scientific circles. Two planetary scientists appraise the possibility of the existence of Martian life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Planetary Scientist 1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The existence of Martian life is quite probable. True, the visions of Martian civilizations entertained by early astronomers, who observed artificial canal systems on Mars, proved false; these &quot;canals&quot; were only illusions produced by flawed telescope lenses. Life, however, can take simpler forms than the humanoid creatures envisioned by early scientists. Although Mars could probably not support large fauna, organisms as complex as bacteria or even small insects are quite plausible. Many environmental factors favor the development of Martian life. Spectrographic analysis has shown the white polar caps of Mars to be large ice deposits, potentially supplying life-supporting water to regions near the Martian poles, as polar ice melts and re-freezes with changing temperatures. Although atmospheric oxygen is extremely thin on Mars, Martian organisms might have correspondingly slow metabolisms, or take advantage of the abundant oxygen trapped in the Martian surface in the form of mineral oxides. Finally, Mars occupies an orbital position similar to that of Earth, thereby benefiting from similar levels of the sunlight which is necessary to life. Water, oxygen, and sunlight are the principle requirements of life as we know it. It is to be expected therefore that life has developed on Mars as on Earth, if only in simpler forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
