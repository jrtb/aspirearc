		<string>&lt;b&gt;Sally&apos;s Fancy Hair Emporium&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To step into Sally&apos;s Fancy Hair Emporium is to step into the past. [1] &lt;u&gt;Scarcely little has&lt;/u&gt; changed in this hair salon, the last of a dying breed. Situated in the middle of what [2] &lt;u&gt;once used to be&lt;/u&gt; a busy shopping district, Sally&apos;s is now the lone storefront in a sea of abandoned buildings and transient hotels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the walls are faded photographs of outdated hairstyles towering beehives and bouffant flips each [3] &lt;u&gt;more outrageous than&lt;/u&gt; the last. Three corners of the shop are dominated by shiny pink and chrome hair-styling stations. The fourth houses a much older station, its pale blue partitions cracked and dusty, dotted with memorabilia of its past occupant &quot;Betty,&quot; according to a dirty nameplate hanging from a single tack. Betty&apos;s station has a ghostly aura. [4] A browning postcard with palm trees proclaims &quot;Greetings from Cape May!&quot; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[5] The latest gossip flew around the lively atmosphere like so much hair spray. On a Friday the salons were extra crowded [6] &lt;u&gt;around&lt;/u&gt; women beautifying themselves for the coming weekend festivities little Lena Jean&apos;s wedding or Faye Dobson&apos;s husband&apos;s funeral. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With today&apos;s [7] &lt;u&gt;wash and wear hairstyles&lt;/u&gt;, beauty salons have taken [8] &lt;u&gt;over a&lt;/u&gt; completely different identity. Busy executives are in and out, hair wet, on the way to the gym or their next appointment. The homey atmosphere of the local beauty parlor [9] &lt;u&gt;has gone the&lt;/u&gt; way of that of the neighborhood barbershop both are utilitarian but somehow lacking in charm. [10] Just as in the rest of the world, the old customs &lt;u&gt;are replacing the new in hair salons&lt;/u&gt;. The reality is that [11] &lt;u&gt;the convivial atmosphere will actually remember only a few old-timers&lt;/u&gt; of places like [12] &lt;u&gt;Sally&apos;s, which the&lt;/u&gt; next generation of young [13] &lt;u&gt;women will have only the memories&lt;/u&gt; of their elders from which to draw on as a vision of the past. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next generation will be forced to settle [14] &lt;u&gt;with&lt;/u&gt; a lackluster approximation of this unique women&apos;s [15] &lt;u&gt;experience. Or create&lt;/u&gt; a new version of the age-old tradition on their own. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use [9] Above</string>
