&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
It was cold and an icy wind that blewalong Broadway and up through the narrowside street where Danny lived, a fierce windthat came off the river, which I could not see
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; for the darkness. The house was small, threestories, red brick, and old, very old. Fiveworn, stone stairs, a badly fitting woodendoor, a tiny overheated foyer withmailboxes, buttons, and nameplates. I
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt; pressed the button over the name Saunders. There was a loud answering buzz. I pushed open the heavy inner door and started up the steep, carpeted, narrow staircase. The door closed with a loud click. It was a little
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;15&lt;/b&gt; before eight o&apos;clock. Someone inside the house was frying bacon. The staircase was poorly lighted; the carpet was worn. It was a long climb up to the third floor. Danny was waiting for me in his
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;20&lt;/b&gt; doorway. He had on a dark woolen sweater and dark trousers. There was a skullcap on his head. His face was pale and he blinked at me wearily from behind his black shell- rimmed glasses.
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;25&lt;/b&gt; &quot;How are you, Danny? How are you really?&quot; &quot;Tired.&quot; &quot;You&apos;re always tired. Whenever I see you you&apos;re tired.&quot;
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;30&lt;/b&gt; &quot;It&apos;s the occupational disease of graduate school.&quot; &quot;How is Rachel?&quot; &quot;Rachel is fine.&quot; He sat down on the chair in front of
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;35&lt;/b&gt; the desk and did not look at me. &quot;Tell me about Michael,&quot; I said. He picked up his coffee cup, sipped some coffee, and put it back down on the desk.
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;40&lt;/b&gt; &quot;Michael is very sick.&quot; &quot;Thanks. Now tell me something about Michael I don&apos;t already know.&quot; &quot;You&apos;re angry,&quot; he said. &quot;I can&apos;t talk to you when you&apos;re angry.&quot;
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;45&lt;/b&gt; &quot;Tell me about Michael,&quot; I said quietly. &quot;What does he do?&quot; &quot;He doesn&apos;t do anything. He comes into a therapy session and just sits there. Oon&apos;t cooperate at all.&quot; &quot;Are you taking over the therapy?&quot; &quot;Yes. They&apos;re willing to try almost anything now. It&apos;s very serious with Michael.&quot;
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;55&lt;/b&gt; I found I could not stop thinking about Michael. There was the lake again and Michael&apos;s thin body near the center board of the sailfish and the gusting winds and the clouds scudding smoothly across the
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;60&lt;/b&gt; sky. &quot;There have been fist fights. Between Michael and some of the other boys.&quot; &quot;Fist fights,&quot; I said. I could not
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;65&lt;/b&gt; imagine Michael in a fist fight. &quot;He kicked a boy in the groin. During a lunch hour. He pushed him out of the chair and kicked him&quot;. &quot;How much time do you have?&quot;
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;70&lt;/b&gt; &quot;A month. Two months. It depends on whether there&apos;s any kind of progress&quot;. &quot;What if there&apos;s no progress, Danny?&quot; He glanced down at his desk and
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;75&lt;/b&gt; said nothing. &quot;Will he have to be institutionalized?&quot; I said. He did not say anything. &quot;My God,&quot; I said. &quot;My God....All
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;80&lt;/b&gt; because of a stupid carnival.&quot; He looked at me. &quot;Michael was sick long before that carnival. Crooks at carnivals don&apos;t make people sick. You have to be sick already to be affected that way.
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;85&lt;/b&gt; &quot;We had a beautiful time on that lake. He liked to read clouds. Did I tell you about that? He reads clouds.&quot; &quot;You told me.&quot; I finished the coffee. &quot;The summer
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;90&lt;/b&gt; seems very far away.&quot; He was quiet. &quot;It is far away,&quot; I said. I put the empty coffee cup on the floor and leaned back against the wall and closed my eyes. I
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;95&lt;/b&gt; could not stop thinking about Michael....There was the cove and the smooth shallow water with the tall trees of the shoreline breaking the force of the wind and Michael lying on his back reading the
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;100&lt;/b&gt; clouds. There was the cove and the birds  high overhead and the clouds white against  the deep blue of the sky and the whisper of  the wind through the trees, a loud  whisper...and I saw Michael standing up in
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;105&lt;/b&gt; the roller coaster, his face to the wind...and  the sensation of dropping into the night.
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;50&lt;/b&gt; absolute lies. He won&apos;t cooperate at all.&quot; &quot;Are you taking over the therapy?&quot; &quot;Yes. They&apos;re willing to try almost anything now. It&apos;s very serious with Michael.&quot;
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;55&lt;/b&gt; I found I could not stop thinking about Michael. There was the lake again and Michael&apos;s thin body near the center board of the sailfish and the gusting winds and the clouds scudding smoothly across the
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;60&lt;/b&gt; sky. &quot;There have been fist fights. Between Michael and some of the other boys.&quot; &quot;Fist fights,&quot; I said. I could not
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;65&lt;/b&gt; imagine Michael in a fist fight. &quot;He kicked a boy in the groin. During a lunch hour. He pushed him out of the chair and kicked him&quot;. &quot;How much time do you have?&quot;
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;70&lt;/b&gt; &quot;A month. Two months. It depends on whether there&apos;s any kind of progress&quot;. &quot;What if there&apos;s no progress, Danny?&quot; He glanced down at his desk and
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;75&lt;/b&gt; said nothing. &quot;Will he have to be institutionalized?&quot; I said. He did not say anything. &quot;My God,&quot; I said. &quot;My God....All
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;80&lt;/b&gt; because of a stupid carnival.&quot; He looked at me. &quot;Michael was sick long before that carnival. Crooks at carnivals don&apos;t make people sick. You have to be sick already to be affected that way.
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;85&lt;/b&gt; &quot;We had a beautiful time on that lake. He liked to read clouds. Did I tell you about that? He reads clouds.&quot; &quot;You told me.&quot; I finished the coffee. &quot;The summer
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;90&lt;/b&gt; seems very far away.&quot; He was quiet. &quot;It is far away,&quot; I said. I put the empty coffee cup on the floor and leaned back against the wall and closed my eyes. I
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;95&lt;/b&gt; could not stop thinking about Michael....There was the cove and the smooth shallow water with the tall trees of the shoreline breaking the force of the wind and Michael lying on his back reading the
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;100&lt;/b&gt; clouds. There was the cove and the birds  high overhead and the clouds white against  the deep blue of the sky and the whisper of  the wind through the trees, a loud  whisper...and I saw Michael standing up in
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;105&lt;/b&gt; the roller coaster, his face to the wind...and  the sensation of dropping into the night.

It was cold and an icy wind that blewalong Broadway and up through the narrowside street where Danny lived, a fierce windthat came off the river, which I could not see
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; for the darkness. The house was small, threestories, red brick, and old, very old. Fiveworn, stone stairs, a badly fitting woodendoor, a tiny overheated foyer withmailboxes, buttons, and nameplates. I
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt; pressed the button over the name Saunders. There was a loud answering buzz. I pushed open the heavy inner door and started up the steep, carpeted, narrow staircase. The door closed with a loud click. It was a little
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;15&lt;/b&gt; before eight o&apos;clock. Someone inside the house was frying bacon. The staircase was poorly lighted; the carpet was worn. It was a long climb up to the third floor. Danny was waiting for me in his
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;20&lt;/b&gt; doorway. He had on a dark woolen sweater and dark trousers. There was a skullcap on his head. His face was pale and he blinked at me wearily from behind his black shell- rimmed glasses.
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;25&lt;/b&gt; &quot;How are you, Danny? How are you really?&quot; &quot;Tired.&quot; &quot;You&apos;re always tired. Whenever I see you you&apos;re tired.&quot;
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;30&lt;/b&gt; &quot;It&apos;s the occupational disease of graduate school.&quot; &quot;How is Rachel?&quot; &quot;Rachel is fine.&quot; He sat down on the chair in front of
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;35&lt;/b&gt; the desk and did not look at me. &quot;Tell me about Michael,&quot; I said. He picked up his coffee cup, sipped some coffee, and put it back down on the desk.

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
It was cold and an icy wind that blewalong Broadway and up through the narrowside street where Danny lived, a fierce windthat came off the river, which I could not see
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; for the darkness. The house was small, threestories, red brick, and old, very old. Fiveworn, stone stairs, a badly fitting woodendoor, a tiny overheated foyer withmailboxes, buttons, and nameplates. I
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt; pressed the button over the name Saunders. There was a loud answering buzz. I pushed open the heavy inner door and started up the steep, carpeted, narrow staircase. The door closed with a loud click. It was a little
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;15&lt;/b&gt; before eight o&apos;clock. Someone inside the house was frying bacon. The staircase was poorly lighted; the carpet was worn. It was a long climb up to the third floor. Danny was waiting for me in his
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;20&lt;/b&gt; doorway. He had on a dark woolen sweater and dark trousers. There was a skullcap on his head. His face was pale and he blinked at me wearily from behind his black shell- rimmed glasses.
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;25&lt;/b&gt; &quot;How are you, Danny? How are you really?&quot; &quot;Tired.&quot; &quot;You&apos;re always tired. Whenever I see you you&apos;re tired.&quot;
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;30&lt;/b&gt; &quot;It&apos;s the occupational disease of graduate school.&quot; &quot;How is Rachel?&quot; &quot;Rachel is fine.&quot; He sat down on the chair in front of
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;35&lt;/b&gt; the desk and did not look at me. &quot;Tell me about Michael,&quot; I said. He picked up his coffee cup, sipped some coffee, and put it back down on the desk.
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;40&lt;/b&gt; &quot;Michael is very sick.&quot; &quot;Thanks. Now tell me something about Michael I don&apos;t already know.&quot; &quot;You&apos;re angry,&quot; he said. &quot;I can&apos;t talk to you when you&apos;re angry.&quot;
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;45&lt;/b&gt; &quot;Tell me about Michael,&quot; I said quietly. &quot;What does he do?&quot; &quot;He doesn&apos;t do anything. He comes into a therapy session and just sits there. Or he spouts dreams and fantasies that are
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;50&lt;/b&gt; absolute lies. He won&apos;t cooperate at all.&quot; &quot;Are you taking over the therapy?&quot; &quot;Yes. They&apos;re willing to try almost anything now. It&apos;s very serious with Michael.&quot;
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;55&lt;/b&gt; I found I could not stop thinking about Michael. There was the lake again and Michael&apos;s thin body near the center board of the sailfish and the gusting winds and the clouds scudding smoothly across the
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;60&lt;/b&gt; sky. &quot;There have been fist fights. Between Michael and some of the other boys.&quot; &quot;Fist fights,&quot; I said. I could not
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;65&lt;/b&gt; imagine Michael in a fist fight. &quot;He kicked a boy in the groin. During a lunch hour. He pushed him out of the chair and kicked him&quot;. &quot;How much time do you have?&quot;
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;70&lt;/b&gt; &quot;A month. Two months. It depends on whether there&apos;s any kind of progress&quot;. &quot;What if there&apos;s no progress, Danny?&quot; He glanced down at his desk and
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;75&lt;/b&gt; said nothing. &quot;Will he have to be institutionalized?&quot; I said. He did not say anything. &quot;My God,&quot; I said. &quot;My God....All
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;80&lt;/b&gt; because of a stupid carnival.&quot; He looked at me. &quot;Michael was sick long before that carnival. Crooks at carnivals don&apos;t make people sick. You have to be sick already to be affected that way.
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;85&lt;/b&gt; &quot;We had a beautiful time on that lake. He liked to read clouds. Did I tell you about that? He reads clouds.&quot; &quot;You told me.&quot; I finished the coffee. &quot;The summer
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;90&lt;/b&gt; seems very far away.&quot; He was quiet. &quot;It is far away,&quot; I said. I put the empty coffee cup on the floor and leaned back against the wall and closed my eyes. I
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;95&lt;/b&gt; could not stop thinking about Michael....There was the cove and the smooth shallow water with the tall trees of the shoreline breaking the force of the wind and Michael lying on his back reading the
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;100&lt;/b&gt; clouds. There was the cove and the birds  high overhead and the clouds white against  the deep blue of the sky and the whisper of  the wind through the trees, a loud  whisper...and I saw Michael standing up in
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;105&lt;/b&gt; the roller coaster, his face to the wind...and  the sensation of dropping into the night.
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
When Danny tells the speaker, ÒIt&apos;s very serious with MichaelÓ (lines 53-54), Danny means that:</string>
