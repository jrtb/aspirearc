<b>Sally's Fancy Hair Emporium</b>

To step into Sally's Fancy Hair Emporium is to step into the past. [1] <u>Scarcely little has</u> changed in this hair salon, the last of a dying breed. Situated in the middle of what [2] <u>once used to be</u> a busy shopping district, Sally's is now the lone storefront in a sea of abandoned buildings and transient hotels. 
On the walls are faded photographs of outdated hairstyles––towering beehives and bouffant flips––each [3] <u>more outrageous than</u> the last. Three corners of the shop are dominated by shiny pink and chrome hair-styling stations. The fourth houses a much older station, its pale blue partitions cracked and dusty, dotted with memorabilia of its past occupant––"Betty," according to a dirty nameplate hanging from a single tack. Betty's station has a ghostly aura. [4] A browning postcard with palm trees proclaims "Greetings from Cape May!" 
[5] The latest gossip flew around the lively atmosphere like so much hair spray. On a Friday the salons were extra crowded [6] <u>around</u> women beautifying themselves for the coming weekend festivities––little Lena Jean's wedding––or Faye Dobson's husband's funeral. 
With today's [7] <u>wash and wear hairstyles</u>, beauty salons have taken [8] <u>over a</u> completely different identity. Busy executives are in and out, hair wet, on the way to the gym or their next appointment. The homey atmosphere of the local beauty parlor [9] <u>has gone the</u> way of that of the neighborhood barbershop––both are utilitarian but somehow lacking in charm. [10] Just as in the rest of the world, the old customs <u>are replacing the new in hair salons</u>. The reality is that [11] <u>the convivial atmosphere will actually remember only a few old-timers</u> of places like [12] <u>Sally's, which the</u> next generation of young [13] <u>women will have only the memories</u> of their elders from which to draw on as a vision of the past. 
The next generation will be forced to settle [14] <u>with</u> a lackluster approximation of this unique women's [15] <u>experience. Or create</u> a new version of the age-old tradition on their own.
