Fiveworn, stone stairs, a badly fitting woodendoor, a tiny overheated foyer withmailboxes, buttons, and nameplates.ÊI&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt; pressed the button over the name Saunders.ÊThere was a loud answering buzz.ÊI pushedÊopen the heavy inner door and started up theÊsteep, carpeted, narrow staircase.ÊThe doorÊclosed with a loud click.ÊIt was a little&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;15&lt;/b&gt; before eight o'clock.ÊSomeone inside theÊhouse was frying bacon.ÊThe staircase wasÊpoorly lighted; the carpet was worn.ÊIt wasÊa long climb up to the third floor.ÊDanny was waiting for me in his&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;20&lt;/b&gt; doorway.ÊHe had on a dark woolen sweaterÊand dark trousers.ÊThere was a skullcap onÊhis head.ÊHis face was pale and he blinkedÊat me wearily from behind his black shell-Êrimmed glasses.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;25&lt;/b&gt; "How are you, Danny?ÊHow areÊyou really?"Ê"Tired."Ê"You're always tired.ÊWhenever IÊsee you you're tired."&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;30&lt;/b&gt; "It's the occupational disease ofÊgraduate school."Ê"How is Rachel?"Ê"Rachel is fine."ÊHe sat down on the chair in front of&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;35&lt;/b&gt; the desk and did not look at me.Ê"Tell me about Michael," I said.ÊHe picked up his coffee cup, sippedÊsome coffee, and put it back down on theÊdesk.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;40&lt;/b&gt; "Michael is very sick."Ê"Thanks.ÊNow tell me somethingÊabout Michael I don't already know."Ê"You're angry," he said.Ê"I can'tÊtalk to you when you're angry."&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;45&lt;/b&gt; "Tell me about Michael," I saidÊquietly.Ê"What does he do?"Ê"He doesn't do anything.ÊHe comesÊinto a therapy session and just sits there.ÊOr he spouts dreams and fantasies that are&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;50&lt;/b&gt; absolute lies.ÊHe won't cooperate at all."Ê"Are you taking over the therapy?"Ê"Yes.ÊThey're willing to try almostÊanything now.ÊIt's very serious withÊMichael."&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;55&lt;/b&gt; I found I could not stop thinkingÊabout Michael.ÊThere was the lake againÊand Michael's thin body near the centerÊboard of the sailfish and the gusting windsÊand the clouds scudding smoothly across the&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;60&lt;/b&gt; sky.Ê"There have been fist fights.ÊBetween Michael and some of the otherÊboys."Ê"Fist fights," I said.ÊI could not&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;65&lt;/b&gt; imagine Michael in a fist fight.Ê"He kicked a boy in the groin.ÊDuring a lunch hour.ÊHe pushed him out ofÊthe chair and kicked him".Ê"How much time do you have?"&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;70&lt;/b&gt; "A month.ÊTwo months.ÊIt dependsÊon whether there's any kind of progress".Ê"What if there's no progress,ÊDanny?"ÊHe glanced down at his desk and&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;75&lt;/b&gt; said nothing.Ê"Will he have to beÊinstitutionalized?"ÊI said.ÊHe did not say anything.Ê"My God," I said.Ê"My God....All&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;80&lt;/b&gt; because of a stupid carnival."ÊHe looked at me.Ê"Michael was sickÊlong before that carnival.ÊCrooks atÊcarnivals don't make people sick.ÊYou haveÊto be sick already to be affected that way.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;85&lt;/b&gt; "We had a beautiful time on thatÊlake.ÊHe liked to read clouds.ÊDid I tell youÊabout that?ÊHe reads clouds."Ê"You told me."ÊI finished the coffee.Ê"The summer&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;90&lt;/b&gt; seems very far away."ÊHe was quiet.Ê"It is far away," I said.ÊI put theÊempty coffee cup on the floor and leanedÊback against the wall and closed my eyes.ÊI&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;95&lt;/b&gt; could not stop thinking aboutÊMichael....There was the cove and theÊsmooth shallow water with the tall trees ofÊthe shoreline breaking the force of the windÊand Michael lying on his back reading the&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;100&lt;/b&gt; clouds.ÊThere was the cove and the birdsÊÊhigh overhead and the clouds white againstÊÊthe deep blue of the sky and the whisper ofÊÊthe wind through the trees, a loudÊÊwhisper...and I saw Michael standing up in&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;105&lt;/b&gt; the roller coaster, his face to the wind...andÊÊthe sensation of dropping into the night.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;The speakerÕs description indicates that DannyÕs building is all of the following EXCEPT:</string>
